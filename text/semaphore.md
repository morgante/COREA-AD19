In our semaphore project, we were given the chance to devise a novel communication technology. Although traditional semaphores are purely visual, we had the freedom to try different mechanisms so long as they held true to the goal of efficiently conveying information over a relatively short distance.

#### Methodology

From the beginning, we realized that over the short distances involved in our experiment it would be essential to avoid any sort of encoding scheme. While encoding can offer substantial advantages over longer distances (enabling information to be compressed or to travel through an alternative mode, such as sound), in our small distance the time taken for encoding would dominate the time saved from transmitting encoded messages faster. If we could avoid the sender ever having to transpose (or even read) the original message, we could save substantial time.

#### Process

Having thus decided to focus on transmitting the actual physical message, we explored various mechanisms for moving the message across the plaza efficiently. One early idea was to use a balloon anchored on the far side to carry the message across. Another idea was to simply use a sloped string to carry the message across, with gravity carrying the message (attached to a hoop) from the high end to the low end. However, when we tested this idea, fiction proved too overwhelming and the message never reached the opposite end. On further reflection, we realized nothing in the rules required that the mechanism be reusable.

#### Design

With this insight in mind, we came up with the simplest single-use delivery mechanism possible: a string laid across the plaza, with a plastic ring tied to one end. To send the message, <a href="http://yg1262.nyuad.im/">Yufei</a> merely had to tape the message to the plastic ring. I could then pull the message across the plaza to read it.

### Output

As can be seen below, our ultimate output was exactly as simple as our design suggested. Despite this simplicity, our hypothesis proved correct and we had the fastest delivery time. While other teams were busy encoding and decoding messages using complicated schemes, I only had to pull it across to retrieve the message: Yufei didn't even have to read it at all. Though this scheme would not work in hostile conditions (where an enemy could intercept its physical movement) or over longer distances (where the ideal solution is to encode the message into a faster medium), it worked perfectly for our scenario.
