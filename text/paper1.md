## A Brief Ride: The Impact of the Pony Express

No communication technology in history has had its image exceed its impact more than the Pony Express. Developed in April 1960 to connect a rapidly growing California with the East Coast, the Pony Express used over 100 resupply stations to allow riders to carry messages from the Atlantic to the Pacific in only 10 days. Despite the exorbitant expense of using a new horse every 10 miles, the twin factors of an increasingly prominent California and the looming threat of Civil War spurred demand for the development of fast East-West communication systems like the Pony Express. However, the Pony Express was insufficient to satisfy that demand and after less than 2 years of operation it closed down and gave way to the transcontinental telegraph. Despite its brief period of operation, it earned itself a place in the imaginations and memories of Americans for decades to come. Thus, due to a combination of historical circumstance, operational romanticism, and technological advancement, the Pony Express has left a cultural footprint which far exceeded its practical utility.

The Pony Express's cultural importance was burgeoned by the drama of the year it was founded.
