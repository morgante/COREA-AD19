500,000 US postal service employees have found an unexpected savior: they just don’t know who he or she is. No informed commentators had expected any serious submissions in the auction for the postal service’s assets and debts, but a company called Snowshine entered the winning (and sole) bid of $1 at 11:50pm last night, 10 minutes before the auction was set to close. Nothing is known about this mysterious company besides that it was registered earlier this year to an address in Delaware. At publication, calls to the number listed on its filing have all gone unanswered.

Whoever is behind Snowshine must have deep pockets. While the winning bid of $1 is certainly cheap, the conditions attached to ownership are anything but. They will be assuming the $20 billion in debt which the postal service has rung up during the Trump administration, as well being on the hook for thousands of expensive employment contracts. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the postal service will continue to lose approximately $2 billion annually, and that’s assuming dramatic cutbacks in rural delivery services and benefits.

Though Democrats in Congress had opposed the sale, their popularity is at an all-time low after the success of President Trump’s military intervention in Mexico and the resulting construction of a massive border wall. Despite the passage of a last-ditch bill to block the sale, they could not gather enough votes to overcome President Trump’s veto. Thus, the auction went on with rampant speculation as to whether anyone would be either wealthy or crazy enough to bid.

The candidate on the front of everyone’s minds has consistently been Jeff Bezos, whose successful turnaround of *The Washington Post* has served as a model for saving dying companies. Strategically, it would also have made some sense, as Bezos could certainly use the postal service’s physical network to extend and improve his company’s delivery options. Though free 30-minute drone delivery is already available to Amazon Prime customers in urban areas, 70% of the country’s residents remain outside the delivery radius. However, when reached for comment, Bezos replied that he had not submitted a bid. “I am in the business of building new markets, not buying dying he ones.” he added.

Representatives for other potential bidders, including Uber founder Travis Kalanik, also insisted that they had not participated in the auction.

In a surprising move, the Supreme Court has ruled that the sale of the US Postal Service may proceed as planned. In a closely watched case, *United States v. Snowshine LLC*, the government had tried to back out of its sale of the Postal Service assets to Snowshine after it was revealed that operational control of the LLC rests with exiled billionaire Mark Zuckerberg. Ever since publicly disclosing the nature of an order by the National Security Agency to secretly distribute an anti-cryptography virus to Facebook’s 2 billion users, Zuckerberg has been living in Singapore to avoid arrest. Though the government argued that it had the right to block the sale based on Zuckerberg’s outstanding arrest warrant, the Court ruled that because Snowshine does not actually belong to Zuckerberg directly the sale must proceed. All shares of Snowshine are currently held by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, an LLC jointly owned by Zuckerberg’s wife Priscilla and his 4-year-old daughter Max, both of whom are legal US citizens. Therefore, the Court ruled that the sale must proceed. Though this must certainly come as welcome news to the postal workers who have been furloughed for the past 6 months while the case wound its way through the courts, it remains to be seen what the exiled billionaire intends to do with the postal service and his mysterious LLC.

Intel today announced that its upcoming line of processors will contain a quantum micro controller. The i11 line (codenamed Firebridge) will combine a traditional CPU with a small quantum controller, which Intel claims will offer up to 50x boosts in peak performance, particularly in mathematically complex applications like image processing and virtual reality gaming. Though quantum chips have been available to universities and large corporations, this represents the first time that consumers will have access to an affordable quantum chip. While the initial production of quantum computers had been heralded as a new era of computing, their high cost—up to $5,000 for a single chip—has prevented widespread use. Most experts thought a cheaper quantum chip was at least a decade away, but Intel insists that the i11 line will match its current price of as little as $99 despite the inclusion of quantum technology. However, when questioned about how Intel had succeeded in making such a huge leap in affordability, a company spokesman merely cited “proprietary methods.” The chips will go on sale in early November, just in time for the holiday shopping season.

As a digital native, I have never actually sent physical mail before: the closest I have come to that archaic process is returning packages to Amazon by leaving them at my doorstep. Hence, using Facebook’s new RealMail feature has certainly been a novelty. The feature has been nearly a decade in the making, with its physical infrastructure piggybacking on the acquisition of the old USPS assets. Using it feels decidedly old-fashioned, albeit with a modern twist. To request an envelope (the company calls them “MailPods”), you just hit the new envelope icon next to a contact in the Facebook Messenger app. This immediately dispatches a drone to deliver a MailPod to your current location, as well as prompting your selected recipient to provide their fingerprint for security. The pod itself is a rectangular box about 1 inch thick, 13 inches high and 9 inches wide. You can place whatever you want inside, including letters or gifts, before closing the lid and returning it to the drone for delivery. Deliveries within a 5 mile radius are completely free and take less than an hour, while the company is offering same-day deliveries across the country for $20.

In its marketing for the new feature, Facebook has heavily emphasizes the security it offers over both traditional mail and digital solutions. This is accomplished through the proprietary MailPod enclosure, which is purportedly completely tamper-proof. Once you close the lid on the pod, its atomic structure is locked to the recipient’s fingerprint. Any attempt to open the pod through force or hacking will simply cause that lock to break, destroying the contents of the pod. We attempted to break into the pod multiple times and each time we could only retrieve dust, but the staff of The Verge are not trained in physical or digital security.

Facebook claims that this security is essential in a world with ongoing privacy and security threats, but it remains unclear who will actually adopt such a service. Initially, it seems like more of a novelty than a useful product. RealMail is currently only available within the United States, though a Facebook spokesperson said a global rollout is in the works.

Today, I created a Facebook account for the first time. This might come as a surprise to most of you, as I’ve [previously](https://stallman.org/facebook.html) said that Facebook is evil. Even when Mark Zuckerberg made the personal sacrifice of refusing to cooperate with the federal government in their attempts to further erode user privacy, my praise was limited due to this being a problem of his own making: he should never have created a tool so perfectly suited to mass surveillance in the first place. However, with the release of RealMail earlier this week, he has created an antidote to the poison he created. It is a fundamentally secure communication mechanism and seems to be impossible to monitor or surveil. An expert I trust has done a thorough analysis and could not find any flaws in its physical security. Though I dislike the centralization of fingerprint sharing which Facebook encourages through their initial signup process, I have found a way around that and it is actually possible to directly key in a destination user. Hence, I now believe that RealMail is the most secure messaging option available to the public and will only be accepting messages via it. You can send messages to my fingerprint key of 8192R/2A8E4C02.

The hacktivist group Anonymous has announced a stunning discovery. Earlier today, they released the full details of a cryptographic back door embedded in the quantum component of Intel i11 processors. It seems that the back door was designed to actively disable all security protocols used by the computer it is contained on and to surreptitiously collect all available information to a central server. With Intel having sold millions of the i11 chips since their introduction two years ago, this is likely the largest scale security breach the world has ever seen. Though this remains unconfirmed, Anonymous claims that the central server can be traced to the NSA. 

In a controversial move, Anonymous has also released the full keys for accessing the back door on BitTorrent. This means that anyone in the world can access information traversing networks with i11 chips, regardless of what encryption technology is used. Major applications, including Snapchat and Xiamsg, have already been breached by this attack and all major credit card issues have completely disabled online payments for the time being.

Spokespeople for Intel and the NSA could not be reached for comment.

In a landslide victory, Democrats have gained majorities in both the House and the Senate. A full 70% of votes cast last night were in favor of the Democratic Party, a stunning affirmation of the party’s agenda in this year of crisis. This represents a strong indictment of President Trump, as the Democrats put indicting him for his role in authorizing the disastrous cryptographic back door which nearly led to the collapse of the US economy. Despite consistent calls for his resignation, Trump has refused to bow to the pressure, insisting that the NSA’s secret surveillance program was essential to the security of the United States. His impeachment now seems inevitable, with Democrats controlling enough votes in both the House and the Senate to remove him from office.

The election results are also unlikely to come as good news to Facebook shareholders, as a key component in the Democrats’ agenda has been placing a cap on the prices which the company can charge for its RealMail service. Facebook has been enjoying record profits thanks to high prices charged for all commercial RealMail deliveries, which have emerged as the only option for secure message delivery after Anonymous revealed details of the NSA cryptographic back door earlier this year. While the service averted an economic collapse by providing a way to quickly deliver payments without risk of fraud or theft, Facebook has been criticized for profiteering from the situation by charging fees as high as 20% for all RealMail payments. These fees, which have catapulted Facebook to a position as the most valuable company in the world, will be capped at as little as 3% under proposals by Democrats in Congress. Facebook shares are down 18% in pre-market trading this morning.
