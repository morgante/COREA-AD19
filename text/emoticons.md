Although the prompt asked us to create emoticons for our "hometown," I decided to interpret my *hometown* more conceptually as the community which I would call home. For me, this was (and still is), United World College, a boarding school where I spent the last two years of high school. Living in a small and isolated community, we had lots of interesting and important concepts which were at least partially unique to our school.

#### Day Room Discussions

The first concept I immediately jumped to was the experience of staying up all night talking with a random student in the "day room" of our dorm. By far one of the things which made UWC a home was the sense of intimacy with virtually all studentsâ€”you wouldn't just stay up late talking with a friend, but also with a random person. I also wanted to represent the irony of a room being called the "day room" regularly being used all night. Thus, the first conceptual emoticon used the sun and moon heavily:

Everyone immediately understood the reference to time from the sun and moon, as it is a common iconographic trope. However, the mere door was insufficient to signal the day room. Additionally, without any humans in the icon it was hard to convey the social aspect of the concept. Thus, the second pass brought in two different figures and emphasized a traditional icon "room" structure (with the color being yellow to indicate its status as a "day room"):

#### Academic Anxiety

The second concept which I tried to represent was the constant pressure to succeed at the highest levels academically, especially when it came to college admissions and IB examinations. Students would study for hours on end trying to cram even more knowledge into their brains before the final IB exams. To represent this anxiety, I chose to show dozens of drafts piling up to the coveted 42 (the best possible score):

As this concept is somewhat simpler than the first one, it was also easier to grasp. Everyone instantly got the IB reference from the number 42. However, the huge number of drafts visible in the icon proved distracting. For the second version, I focused on tightening up the number of drafts and instead having a much larger "paper" as the emoticon's focal point. Indeed, in this version, I used just 6 pieces of paper, to represent he 6 subjects every IB student takes:

#### Social Isolation

The final concept which I focused on was the intense isolation of attending a tiny boarding school in the middle of the New Mexico wilderness. This isolation forced us together, as there were literally no other people for miles upon miles. Yet, as the student body was extremely international (even more so than NYUAD), after this physical isolation we had to endure the even greater isolation of being separated from our closest friends by thousands of miles after graduation. To represent isolation, I chose a simple mountain range:

This final concept proved to be trickiest of all. While everyone understood that the emoticon included mountains, the social connection was too complicated for my friends to grasp. Instead, most of them thought it was merely about wilderness or the New Mexico setting of UWC. Therefore, for the second version, I decided to completely abandon the mountain concept and instead focused on the global dispersion which characterizes UWC.
